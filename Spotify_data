  For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
  Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
  Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

1. HOW to see how many songs are by the artist BTS.

SELECT*
FROM Spotify 
WHERE artist_name = 'BTS';

2. HOW TO SHOW artists songs that are at popularity greater than 80 liming results to 5

SELECT *
FROM Spotifydata
WHERE POPUlarity >80
LIMIT 5;

3. How to select track names that have a danceeability greater than 0.50 AND energy greater than 0.70.

SELECT track_name
FROM Spotifydata
WHERE danceability >0.50 AND energy > 0.70;

4. How to get the average energy of all the artist where the energy is more than 0.65.

SELECT artist_name,avg(energy)as avg_energy
FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
HAVING avg_energy>0.65;

5. How to see all the artist where they have more than 2 songs logged into the spotify data.

SELECT artist_name
FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
HAVING count(*) >2;

6. how to determine the avg popularity, danceability, and energy by artist and track. 

SELECT
artist_name
,track_name
,avg(popularity)
,avg(danceability)
,avg(energy)
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name

7. how to find the Top 10 artists are by popularity.

SELECT track_name, artist_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10
